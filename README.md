## Installation
1. Set database backup on mysql:

    C. Click on start import to save tables with data.
2. Set database user and password in php to connection
    A. Go to assignment2/server/db.php and under the comment //USER CREDENTIALS, write your own mysql credentials to connect to server.
3. Set client link to communicate with backend. 
    A. Inside assignment2 -> frontend, you will find connectionServer.js
    B. in the first like there is a code similar to this: const LOCALHOSTDIR = "http://localhost/assignment2";
    C. Change the link based on your folder structure: if you are charging project from localhost/projects/assignment2 then that line of code should be changed to that. the parent folder or "localhost" equals to the file htdocs in the xampp folder. So if:
    project path is like this: C:\xampp\htdocs\assignment2, LOCALHOSTDIR should be "http://localhost/assignment2".
